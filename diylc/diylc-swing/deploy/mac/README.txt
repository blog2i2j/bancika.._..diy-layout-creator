Thank you for downloading DIY Layout Creator!

This app bundle is fully functional but not officially notarized by Apple.
To run it on your Mac, you'll need to approve it in the 'Privacy & Security' settings.

Without this approval, macOS will mark it as potentially damaged and prevent it from opening.

A notarized version is available, but due to Apple Developer Program costs and additional requirements,
it is exclusively offered to DIYLC Patreon supporters. For a small monthly membership fee,
you'll receive several benefits:

- Access to the notarized version
- Early access to upcoming features
- Voting rights to influence the development roadmap
- Direct developer support
